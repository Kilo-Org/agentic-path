# Agent Instructions

## Running the server

Typically the server will already be running at http://localhost:4321. Check that first with the browser or a curl before attempting to run it.

If it is not running, please ask the user BEFORE you decide to run a command.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```
