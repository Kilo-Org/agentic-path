Autonomous agents are building entire applications from a single prompt, [contributing to open source projects](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132), and even [making dinner reservations](https://youtu.be/0iTb3a6eqKg) on behalf of humans. 
This is all fine and good for hobby projects and scrappy startups, but for many engineering teams, integrating these tools into a real-world production environment feels out of reach.

If you feel like you’re falling behind or that the promises of “agentic engineering” are unrealistic for complex, high-stakes legacy systems, this resource is for you. 
Agentic Engineering for Humans is the beginning of a pragmatic, hype-free map for managing this transition—a community-driven repository where real engineers can share what’s worked for them. 

[Choose your path](/#choose-your-path) to start reclaiming your time from tedious tasks and focus on high-value problems instead, or [contribute](/community/contributing/) to help make this a living document of what is actually happening in the field.
