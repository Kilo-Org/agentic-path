Your team's effectiveness with agents varies widely. Some engineers will thrive immediately. Others will struggle. Your job is to close that gap.

## The skill distribution

Expect a distribution:

**Early adopters (10-20%):** Already experimenting. May have strong opinions. Use them as resources.

**Curious middle (50-60%):** Open but need guidance. Want to learn but don't know where to start.

**Skeptics (20-30%):** Range from cautious to resistant. Some have valid concerns. Some need to see proof.

All three groups need different approaches.

## Training the early adopters

They don't need convincing. They need:

**Time and permission.** Let them experiment. Don't make them justify every tool trial.

**Challenges.** Give them hard problems to solve with agents. Push the boundaries of what's possible.

**Platform to share.** Ask them to document what works. Use them to mentor others.

**Guardrails.** Their enthusiasm may outpace judgment. Help them understand limits.

## Training the curious middle

This is your main audience. They need:

### Hands-on workshops

Don't lecture. Do.

**Format:** 90-minute sessions, 70% hands-on.

**Content:**

- Session 1: First prompt to working code
- Session 2: Task decomposition practice
- Session 3: Validating and fixing agent output
- Session 4: Real project work with support

**Outcomes:** Each person leaves with successful agent experience.

### Pairing and shadowing

Pair curious engineers with early adopters for:

- Real task work, not demos
- Live troubleshooting when agents fail
- Exposure to effective prompting in practice

### Curated resources

Create a team resource with:

- Recommended tools and settings
- Prompt templates that work for your stack
- Examples of successful agent use in your codebase
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them

## Training skeptics

Don't force it. Address concerns legitimately.

**Common concerns and responses:**

_"It will make engineers less skilled."_
Show them that agents amplify skill, not replace it. Weak engineers struggle with agents too.

_"The output quality is poor."_
Demonstrate good output with good prompts. Quality is about usage, not just tools.

_"It's a fad."_
Share market data. Show that major companies are standardizing on these tools.

_"It's not worth the learning curve."_
Start them on high-ROI, low-risk tasks: tests, documentation, boilerplate.

**Give them space.** Some people need to watch peers succeed before adopting. That's okay.

## Building the curriculum

### Beginner track

1. Introduction to agent concepts (async reading)
2. First agent experience (workshop)
3. Daily use of copilot-level tools (practice)
4. Supervised task-level agent use (pairing)

### Intermediate track

1. Task decomposition mastery (workshop + practice)
2. Handling failure modes (case studies)
3. Complex multi-file tasks (mentored practice)
4. Code review for AI code (workshop)

### Advanced track

1. Building custom prompts and workflows
2. Evaluating new tools
3. Teaching others
4. Shaping team practices

## Measuring training effectiveness

**Before training:**

- Survey confidence levels
- Track tool adoption rates
- Note existing competencies

**After training:**

- Survey again (same questions)
- Track application of skills
- Gather qualitative feedback

**Long term:**

- Adoption persistence
- Quality of agent use
- Peer mentoring emergence
