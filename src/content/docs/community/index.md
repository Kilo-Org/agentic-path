Agentic engineering is new territory. Nobody has all the answers. The best way to learn is together.

## Why community matters

AI tools change weekly. What worked last month might be obsolete. What you discovered yesterday might help someone today.

**This isn't just documentation—it's a conversation.** We're building shared knowledge about a field that's still being invented.

## Where to connect

### Discord

**[Join our Discord →](https://kilo.love/discord)**

The fastest way to get help and share what you're learning:

- Ask questions (no question is too basic)
- Share wins and failures
- Discuss new tools and techniques
- Get feedback on your approach

### GitHub Discussions

**[Browse discussions →](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/agentic-path/discussions)**

For longer-form conversations:

- Propose new content or features
- Debate best practices
- Share detailed case studies
- Discuss the future of agentic engineering

### GitHub Issues

**[View issues →](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/agentic-path/issues)**

For specific improvements:

- Report bugs or broken links
- Request new topics
- Track work in progress

## How to participate

### Share your experience

The most valuable contributions are real stories:

- What worked when you tried a new approach?
- What failed spectacularly?
- What do you wish you'd known earlier?
- What's different about your context (language, team size, industry)?

### Ask questions

Seriously. Your questions help everyone:

- They reveal gaps in the documentation
- They surface common confusion points
- They often lead to better explanations

### Help others

When you figure something out, share it:

- Answer questions in Discord
- Add resources to relevant pages
- Write up your experience as a case study

## Community guidelines

### Be excellent to each other

- Assume good intent
- Respectful disagreement is welcome
- Personal attacks are not
- Help newcomers feel welcome

### Share honestly

- Admit when you don't know
- Include failures, not just successes
- Cite sources when sharing others' work
- No marketing or self-promotion

### Stay practical

- Focus on what actually works
- Share specific examples
- Avoid hype and buzzwords
- Question claims that sound too good

## What we're building together

This guide is open source. Every page can be improved. Every section can be expanded.

**Your experience is the content.** We're not writing theory—we're documenting what works in practice. That requires input from people doing the work.

See [Contributing](/community/contributing/) to get started.

## Recognition

We recognize contributors through:

- Git history (your commits are permanent)
- GitHub contributors page
- Shoutouts for significant contributions
- Community spotlights in Discord
