New tools launch constantly. Here's a framework for evaluating them without getting lost in the hype.

## Core criteria

### Output quality

The most important factor. A tool that produces bad output isn't useful regardless of features.

**Evaluate:**

- Quality on tasks similar to your actual work
- Consistency across multiple attempts
- Edge case handling
- Domain-specific performance (your languages, frameworks, patterns)

**How to test:**

- Run your actual tasks through trial periods
- Compare output to what senior engineers would produce
- Note failure modes and frequency

### Context handling

How well does the tool understand and use context?

**Evaluate:**

- How much code can it see at once?
- Does it use context effectively?
- Can it understand your project structure?
- Does it maintain coherence across longer sessions?

**How to test:**

- Try tasks that require understanding multiple files
- Test with large/complex codebases
- See if it references relevant but not explicitly provided code

### Task scope

What level of task can the tool handle?

**Evaluate:**

- Single function to entire features?
- Single file to multi-file changes?
- Works best in dialogue or autonomous?

**How to test:**

- Try progressively larger tasks
- Note where quality degrades
- Identify the tool's comfort zone

### Speed and responsiveness

How quickly can you iterate?

**Evaluate:**

- Time to first response
- Time to complete typical tasks
- Impact on your workflow

**How to test:**

- Time real tasks
- Consider total turnaround (prompting + waiting + reviewing)
- Compare to your current approach

## Integration factors

### IDE/workflow integration

Does it fit how you work?

**Evaluate:**

- Supported editors/IDEs
- Inline vs. chat vs. autonomous modes
- Integration with version control
- Keyboard shortcut support

**How to test:**

- Install in your actual environment
- Use for a full work day
- Note friction points

### Team compatibility

Can your whole team use it?

**Evaluate:**

- Seats and licensing model
- Consistent experience across the team
- Collaboration features
- Admin controls

**How to test:**

- Try with multiple team members
- Assess skill variation in usage
- Evaluate management overhead

### Existing toolchain

Does it work with what you already have?

**Evaluate:**

- CI/CD integration
- Version control workflows
- Code review processes
- Security scanning

**How to test:**

- Map required integrations
- Verify each integration works
- Identify gaps

## Operational factors

### Security and privacy

What happens to your code?

**Evaluate:**

- Where is data processed?
- Is data used for training?
- Data retention policies
- Compliance certifications

**How to test:**

- Review privacy policy and terms
- Contact vendor with specific questions
- Get legal/security review on agreements

### Reliability

Can you depend on it?

**Evaluate:**

- Uptime history
- Degradation patterns
- Fallback options when unavailable

**How to test:**

- Check status page history
- Ask for SLA details
- Plan for outages

### Cost model

What will this actually cost?

**Evaluate:**

- Per-seat vs. usage-based pricing
- Cost at full adoption
- Hidden costs (API, storage, etc.)
- Scaling predictability

**How to test:**

- Model costs for your team size
- Understand usage patterns
- Project costs as adoption grows

## Evaluation process

### Phase 1: Initial filtering (1-2 hours)

- Does it work with our tech stack?
- Is pricing in a reasonable range?
- Are there obvious deal-breakers?

### Phase 2: Individual trial (1-2 weeks)

- One or two engineers use for real work
- Document experience: wins and frustrations
- Compare output quality to expectations

### Phase 3: Team pilot (4-6 weeks)

- Expand to small team or specific project
- Assess team-level factors
- Measure against baseline productivity

### Phase 4: Decision (1 week)

- Gather feedback systematically
- Compare against alternatives trialed
- Make recommendation with evidence

## Red flags

**Watch out for:**

- Demos that don't match real-world performance
- Unclear pricing that scales unexpectedly
- Data handling policies that don't match your requirements
- Vendor instability or unclear roadmap
- Lock-in without data portability
