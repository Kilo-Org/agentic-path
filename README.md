# Agentic Engineering for Humans

Real-world guides and resources for learning how software engineering and leadership works in a post-AI world.

🌐 **Live site:** [path.kilo.ai](https://path.kilo.ai)

## What is this?

This is a comprehensive guide to agentic engineering—the practice of working effectively with AI coding agents. Whether you're an engineer learning to prompt effectively, a team lead integrating agents into workflows, or an executive building an adoption strategy, there's a path for you.

**This is a community project.** We're building this together because the field moves fast and no single perspective captures everything. Your experience matters—whether you've been using AI tools for years or just started last week.

## Content
